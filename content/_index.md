## The Tartan Dictionary

The aim of this dictionary is to promote the use of Tartan and preserve the Celtic traditions of Hallstadt.  They seem to have spread out over the world and been reinvented several times.
I am particularly looking at the weaving pattern of a 2/2 twill with pattern of stripes.

The approach is to look at the whole of the tartan tradition and to look at ways of identifying tartans not only by their weaving count but also by the pattern eg the number of stripes and the number of different types of stripes eg thick thin. 

The first aim is to collect all the online tartans and then order them.

# Warning Alpha stage
This is an alpha version and so things may well change eg the conversion of colours to normalised patterns.
