## The Tartan Dictionary

The aim of this dictionary is to promote the use of Tartan and preserve the Celtic traditions of Hallstadt.

Trying to work out the Drummonds of Megginch tartan sparked my interest in Tartan and its evolution.  Thanks to Bertie Drummond-Herdman and Lexa Drummond for sorting out colours and patterns for the Drummond of Megginch tartan.

This is my attempt to make sense of it all.
