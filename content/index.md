## The Tartan Dictionary

The aim of this dictionary is to promote the use of Tartan and preserve the Celtic traditions of Hallstadt.

The approach is to look at the whole of the tartan tradition and to look at ways of identifying tartans not only by their weaving count but also by the pattern eg the number of stripes.

The first aim is to collect all the online tartans and then order them.
