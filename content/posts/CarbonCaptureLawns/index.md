I have a robot mower that mows my grass.  I was wondering if it actually captures carbon.

I can see that the soil is capturing soil as it is getting higher.  I had an edging made of bricks and over the last 15 year the grass has crept up ca 15cm.  So about 1 cm a year capture.  This is a capture of carbon but need to do the calculations to see if overall positive.
