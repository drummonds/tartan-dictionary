Lists of tartan colours are important for a dictionary as you need to allow some variation for colours and yet still be the same thread count descriptions.

In the first instance I am using the 19 colour names from the Tartan Registry although I am very tempted to using on the 6 basic colours that are common to almost all languages White Black, Red, Green, Blue and Yellow.
