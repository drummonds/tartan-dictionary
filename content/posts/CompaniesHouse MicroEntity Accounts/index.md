# Glossary
This is taken from Companies House notes (side bar on side)

## TCA Total Current Assets
In the companies house help this is referred to as *Current Assets*.   
`Cash or resources held for the purpose of converting into cash, these include stock, 
debtors and investments.`   
`For micro-entity accounts current assets are not required to be broken down further, 
although a more detailed breakdown may be provided if you wish.`

## Prepayments and accrued income
`Advance payments and sales that the company has not yet recorded in its books.`
`For micro-entity accounts this is not required other than for the cost of raw 
materials and consumables, value adjustments, staff costs and tax.`
