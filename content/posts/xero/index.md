# Directors loan

## Directors loan Pay money in.

The standard directors loan account is NC 835.  This can be marked
so that you can `Enable payments to this account`

When you pay money into the company for working capital.

### From other source
Set up a liability account in Xero. Code the 600 pounds to this account
and the monthly payments. You then need to do a journal Debit equipment
purchases and Credit the liability account. You may need to consider
interest on the loan - not sure how your tax laws work, would be worth discussing with your accountant.

# Client Account

This is very similar to a directors loan.  However it is where Company A, the parent,
holds money on account in bare trust for another eg Company B.


The important point is that every transaction in the nominal code in A
should have an equal transaction in company B.  This is a bit of a pain to enter manually.

## Reconciliation
This is currently manual - just do an Account Transactions report for the nominal code in each company.  The final
balance should be the same.

## Receiving money

When money is received this is a current liability for drummonds.net as this is money which is payable on demand.  This
is modelled in Xero as a current liability account. eg:


Nominal Code| Company    | Type
------------|------------|------------
110         | Drummonds  | Current Liability
110         | Pumba      | Bank account, Current asset


The transactions are like this:

Company | Details | Transaction
--------|---------|------------
Drummonds | Receive money for account Client A/C eg NC 110 from X|
Pumba | Receive money from X |

### Step by Step

- Snip the image of the receipt for storage
- Receipt of money to parent (click on plus sign &#8594; Receive Money). This needs to coded to the correct nominal code.
    - Current account
    - Received as Direct Payment
    - Name Pumba Client account
    - N/C 110
    - Description eg Receipt from SARL
- Receipt of money to client
    
#### Receipt of money to parent

So in Drummonds you will have a bank reconciliation entry for money received:

which will end up:

[Transaction Receive Money](2018-02-24TransactionReceiveMoney.png)

Type                 | NC | Value before  | Value After
---------------------|----|---------------|------------
Pumba Client account | Record | 0.0 | Marked as Due 
Pumba Client         |110| 1,475.36 | 3,093.98 | Marked as Due
P&L                  | PBT | 9,708| 9,708
BS                   | Net Assets | 18,104 | 18,104

#### Receipt of money to client
Goto invoice and mark as paid.  Any overpayment will turn up as an overpayment.  Which will need to be written off.
If paying a number of deposits mark as an overpayment to the account and then pay off each invoice.
